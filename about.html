            <h2>Domestic Violence can take many forms</h2>
            <p>Domestic Violence is a multifaceted issue that has many misunderstandings surrounding it. While a staggering number of women (approximately one in every four) are impacted by domestic violence, so too are men (approximately one in every eight). Fortunately, there are abundant resources available to help those in hurtful environments <strong><em>escape</em> from domestic violence</strong> situations. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough awareness about the aftermath of domestic violence: the long-term trauma caused by intimate partner abuse or the pathway to rehabilitate abusers so that they may learn how to manage and prevent abusive tendencies. The hope is to enable both the abused and the abusive to have healthy and safe relationships and break the cycle of violence. </p>
            <br />
            <h3>What is Domestic Violence?</h3>
            <p>The definition of domestic violence, according to <em>Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook</em> that was written by Margi L. McCue, <q cite="McCue, M.L. (1995). Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook. ABC-CLIO">and commonly accepted by legal professionals is the emotional, physical, psychological, or sexual abuse perpetrated against a person by that person’s spouse, former spouse, partner, former partner, or by the other parent of a minor child. In a June 1994 speech, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala referred to domestic violence as terrorism in the home
            </q> (McCue, 1995). There is a slight difference between the terms <em>battering</em> and <em>abuse</em>, although often used interchangeably. Abuse can be a single instance of domestic violence, whereas a systematic pattern of abuse may escalate over time to battering. Marie Bracciale wrote in her dissertation that
            <q cite="Bracciale, Marie T. (2004). Current status of marriage and family therapists graduate training in identification, assessment, and treatment of relationship violence. [Doctoral Dissertation, University of Florida]. ONLINE - Dissertations. http://uf.catalog.fcla.edu/uf.jsp?st=UF022813945&ix=pm&I=0&V=D&pm=1">it appears [human beings] are most likely to behave aggressively in their most intimate social relationships</q> (Chap 1, page 1) and that <q cite="Bracciale, (2004)">in the United States, violent crimes occur more frequently within families than among strangers</q> (Chap 1, page 3).</p>

              <h2>My Mission</h2>
              <p>After my mom's passing, I set out on a mission to help as many women as I possible can; to help people see their worth so that they never let anyone treat them less than they deserve. That's why <span style="font-family: 'amster-1'">fly</span><span style="font-family:'mr-eaves-xl-modern';text-transform:uppercase;">collective</span> came about; because I wanted to give back to <strong>Domestic Violence </stron><em>survivors</em>.</p>
              <br />
              <p>We all deserve <em>unconditional</em> love</strong>; it's literally our birth right. Unfortunately, we tend to forget this because of all the crappy things that may happen to us throughout our lives. I've been on my <em>self love journey</em> for as long as I can remember, but when my mom was murdered in a domestic violence attack, I was forced to do some <strong>some serious soul searching</strong>. The biggest realization I made was how <strong>important <em>self love</em></strong> is. If my mom had learned to love herself enough, then maybe...just maybe...she would have walked away because she would have known that she <strong> deserved so much more</strong> and she <em>never</em> would have settled for anything less.</p>
              <br />
              <p><strong>How to Stop</strong>. Interpersonal violence needs to be de-escalated before reaching the point of physical violence: it must be addressed through interpersonal communication strategies that avoid negative communication patterns. <q cite="Low, S. M., Monarch, N. D., Hartman, S., & Markman, H. (2002). Recent therapeutic advances in the prevention of domestic violence. In P. A. Schewe (Ed.), Preventing violence in relationships: Interventions across the life span (p. 197–221). American Psychological Association. https://doi-org.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/10.1037/10455-008">For this reason, efforts aimed at preventing marital violence before it occurs must involve the reduction of causal risk factors such as negative communication patterns and the bolstering of protective factors such as healthy commitment and the development of a broader support network</q> (Hartman, et al, 2002). The Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) is a first line of defense against intimate partner abuse as it targets enhancing couples’ communication and conflict resolution skills. Stop Anger and Violence Escalation (SAVE) is a program that educates at risk couples on the consequences of physical aggression in relationships and aims to reduce the couples’ tolerance for such behavior in hopes of encouraging couples to better their conflict resolution and communication skills before resulting to violence. Finally, the Physical Aggression Couples Treatment (PACT) methodology treats already violent couples to help them manage their anger before violence occurs by improving the couples’ communication and conflict resolution skills. The focus is placed on triggers that lead to violent behavior like jealousy, power, and negative communication (Hartman et al, 2002).</p>

          <h3>Types of Abuse</h3>
          <div class="emotional">
            <h4>Emotional and Psychological Abuse</h4>
            <p>Emotional abuse deals with the psychological aspect of domestic violence in that it creates emotional instability within the victim by targeting insecurities, self-esteem, and or the victim’s self-image. It always accompanies physical abuse and <q cite="McCue, M. L. (1995). Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook. ABC-CLIO.">in most cases precedes physical battering</q> (McCue, 1995). Emotional abuse is the psychological terror inflicted by an abuser that makes the victim afraid to leave or causes them to return to abusive relationships.</p>

          <div class="sexual">
            <h4>Sexual Abuse</h4>
            <p>Sexual abuse occurs when the intimate partner coerces or forces the victim to perform sexual acts that make them uncomfortable or that they do not want to do. Additionally, sexual abuse may take the form of sexual harassment, which is any unwanted physical touch, advances, or language of a sexual nature. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="physical">
            <h4>Physical Abuse</h4>
            <p>Any action that causes physical harm to the victim is considered physical abuse, whether as minor as pinching or squeezing, restraining, or holding to overt acts of physical violence that may potentially lead to death. Additionally, <q cite="McCue, M. L. (1995). Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook. ABC-CLIO.">physical abuse may begin in a physically nonviolent way with neglect, which can include failing to meet the victim’s needs for physical intimacy</q> (McCue, 1995).</p>
